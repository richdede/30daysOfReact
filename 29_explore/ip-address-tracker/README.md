## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)
- [Free IP API](https://freeipapi.com/)

### What I learned

I learnt to work with ```useEffect()``` hook and how to fetch data using it. Object destructuring of ```useState()``` was also used in some places like here :

```js
  const [error, seterror] = useState({ errorMsg: "hide", border: "" });

```

### Continued development

I'll continue working with ```useEffect()``` hook and learn other hooks as well like ```useRef()``` and ```useMemo()``` . . .maybe work with Leaflet as well in the future...I'll try to work on JS Regex as well , since this time as well I copied the regex for valid IP Address from the net as well ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…

### Useful resources

- [Free IP API](https://freeipapi.com/) - This helped me as it provided with 60 requests per minute. Other APIs on the other hand provided with 1000 reqs per month . . .which I would have exhausted while building the project, the API data may/may not be a bit compromised  as it is open sourced , but it's fine ig . . .
- [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - This is an amazing documentataion which helped me work with leaflet library and implement the map the way I wanted to. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
